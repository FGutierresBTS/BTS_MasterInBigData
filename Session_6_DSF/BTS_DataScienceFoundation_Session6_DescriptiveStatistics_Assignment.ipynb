    "\n",
    "- Considering the Descriptive Statistics presented in Demo 2 develop a descriptive statistics for the data set “Titanic”. \n",
    "- Commit scripts in your GitHub account. You should export your your solution code (.ipynb notebook) and push it to your repository “DataScienceFoundations”.\n",
    "- The following are the tasks that should complete and synchronize with your repository “DataScienceFoundations” until October 25. Please notice that this task will not be graded, however it’s important that you correctly understand and complete them in order to be sure that you won’t have problems with further assignments.\n",

    "Guidelines:\n",
    "- Clone the Git repository to get an initial code: \n",
    "https://github.com/FGutierresBTS/BTS_MasterInBigData.git\n",
    "- Once you downloaded the repository to your local file system, go to the folder “BTS_MasterInBigData/ Session_6_DSF”. \n",
    "- Copy the folder “Session_6_DSF” into your local folder “DataScienceFoundations”. \n",
    "- In the folder “Session_6_DSF” you will see the files called: \n",
    "    -\tBTS_DataScienceFoundations_Session6_Descriptive_Statistics_Individual_assignment.ipynb.\n",
    "    -   \"1_titanic_dataset.csv\" (note: this dataset must be pre-processed).\n",
    "- Import these files into Jupyter Notebook using the “Upload” button. \n",
    "- Open the imported script and put your code inside the notebook. \n",
    "- Export your Assignment *.ipynb notebook and push it to your repository “DataScienceFoundations”."
